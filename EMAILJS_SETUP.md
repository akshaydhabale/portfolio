## üîí Security Notes

- The `.env` file is already added to `.gitignore`
- Your credentials won't be committed to GitHub
- Public Key is safe to use in frontend (it's designed for that)
- All emails are sent through EmailJS servers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "EmailJS credentials not configured" error
- Make sure `.env` file exists in root folder
- Check that variable names start with `VITE_`
- Restart dev server after changing `.env`

### Form submits but no email received
- Check EmailJS dashboard quota (200/month limit)
- Verify template ID matches exactly
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify Gmail account is connected in EmailJS

### "Failed to send" error
- Check internet connection
- Verify all three credentials are correct
- Check browser console for detailed error
- Try the EmailJS dashboard "Test" button

## üì± Email Template Variables

Available variables you can use in your template:
- `{{from_name}}` - Sender's name
- `{{from_email}}` - Sender's email
- `{{message}}` - Message content
- `{{to_email}}` - Your email (akshaydhabale@gmail.com)

## üöÄ Going Live

When deploying to GitHub Pages:

1. **Using GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to your repo: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add three secrets:
     - `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
     - `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
     - `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`

2. **Or hardcode temporarily:**
   - For static sites, you can hardcode values directly in `Contact.jsx`
   - Public Key is safe to expose (it's meant for frontend)
